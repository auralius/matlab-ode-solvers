# ode-solvers
Implementation of several popular solvers for solving ODEs in MATLAB.

Collections of ODE solvers for an ODE in form of:

y_dot = f(t,y)

The solver then provides the solution of such an ODE in form of

y = f(t,y)

Implemented solvers so far:   
- Forward (Explicit) Euler
- 4th order Runge-Kutta  
- Runge-Kutta 3/8    
- Dormand-Prince   
- Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RKF45)  
- Backward (Implicit) Euler
